Voice Detection for LifeX
=============

Uses sox to detect noise, if the noise detected is substantial(measured by size in kb) then it is sent to wit-ai for analysis. Which then sends back the speakers intent ie light on/off or color ect. Still in testing as wit is still learning, very unreliable.
